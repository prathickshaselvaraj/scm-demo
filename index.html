# SCM Demo — Source Control Management Workflow

A streamlined demonstration of modern Git-based source control workflows, including branching strategy, feature isolation, pull request lifecycle, and integration best practices. This repository models a practical, production-aligned Git workflow used in collaborative engineering teams.

## Project Overview

This project illustrates how a real software team manages code changes through:

- Feature branching
- Pull Request (PR) review pipelines
- Code isolation and conflict prevention
- Clean commit hygiene
- GitHub-based development lifecycle

It serves as a reference implementation for understanding Git fundamentals in a structured, industry-grade manner.

## Repository Structure

└── README.md            # This file

(Structure may evolve as functionality grows.)

## Tech Stack

- Git (version control)
- GitHub (remote hosting and PR workflow)
- Optional integrations:
  - GitHub Actions
  - CodeQL scanning
  - GitHub Project Boards

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>


### 2. Commit Frequently


git add .
git commit -m "Add UI layout for hobbies section"


### 3. Push to GitHub


git push -u origin feature/<feature-name>


### 4. Raise a Pull Request
- Compare against `main`
- Add clear title and description
- Request review before merging

### 5. Merge After Approval
Ensures clean, validated development and predictable integration.

## Current Feature Example

**feature/hobbies-ui**
- Adds structured UI for user hobby details
- Demonstrates incremental UI development via branching
- Serves as a hands-on PR example

## Future Enhancements

- Add GitHub Actions CI
- Introduce automated linting/formatting
- Add unit tests for logic
- Expand modular components inside `src/`
